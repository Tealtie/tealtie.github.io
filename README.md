This site was created to find me and my projects. Not all of my projects may be on the site at any given time. I will try to keep the site up to date. Thank you for all your support!
### Credits

Thanks to Github for making this possible as Github Pages hosts my site, Github.com hosts my project(s) and Github Copilot enabled Code Completions.
#### OpenAI
Thanks to OpenAI for ChatGPT as it helped me correct so many mistakes while making this project a reality.
#### Microsoft
