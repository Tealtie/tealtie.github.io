    <h1>FischingC</h1>
    <h3>A simple text-based fishing game, inspired by Roblox Fisch</h3>
    <h2>Why I made this</h2>
    <p>I'm not the biggest fan of Fisch, in fact I hate (I know that that's a strong word but it's true) it so much.</p>
    <p>It's just that, at its core, it's a simple game. So simple that if you've read my profile's README.md, you'd know that I'm new to this and I'm learning to code. So maybe, if I made a game inspired by something as simple as Fisch, then maybe I'd slowly start to get better at coding?</p>
    <h5>The AMAZING pun is, if you haven't noticed it, FischingC ---> (aim of game to fish, inspired by Fisch) Fishing Sea (coded in C) :)</h5>
